# Data Science Resources
My resources (books, websites, authors, etc.) that I´ve been using to study DS.

I know we got a lot of content and posts out there with hundreds of links and references to study any subject, that´s why this list is my own experience and recommendations I received in the past which really helped and still helps me.

Also, as any list of resources, some of these references might be of help to you.

So... Why not share it ?
